My research focuses on software development, radiation oncology informatics, and applications of Artificial Intelligence tools for Radiotherapy outcomes prediction and diagnosis. Currently, I work under the supervision of Prof. John Kildea, at the [kildedalab](https://kildealab.com), Radiation Oncology Knowledge Sharing (ROKS) team
