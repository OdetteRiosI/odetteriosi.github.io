Hi! I am an international PhD student in Medical Physics at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca) since September 2024. My research focuses on software development, radiation oncology informatics, and applications of Artificial Intelligence tools for Radiotherapy outcomes prediction and diagnosis. Currently, I work under the supervision of Prof. John Kildea, at the [kildedalab](https://kildealab.com), Radiation Oncology Knowledge Sharing (ROKS) team. 

Previously, I pursued my undergraduate studies in Physics in my home country Chile at [Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile](www.uc.cl), where I investigated the potential of radiomics features from MRI images for classifying prostate cancer aggressiveness, under the supervision of Prof. Paola Caprile.
